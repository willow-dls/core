/**
 * This class stores an arbitrary yet fixed-width collection of bits which
 * are sent to {@link CircuitElement}s via {@link CircuitBus}es. Bit strings
 * are immutable, but this class provides a number of useful functions for
 * performing operations with bit strings. Indeed, most of the functionality
 * of an ALU is actually implemented here, not in a dedicate ALU circuit
 * element, making it easy to implement other types of ALUs with ease.
 *
 * The reason this class exists is to bypass entirely the JavaScript `number`
 * data type for sending bits through the circuit simulation, because `number`
 * imposes restrictions on how values can be interpretted, as well as the size
 * of values. `BitString` imposes no such limitations; there is no practical
 * size limit of a bit string.
 *
 * Additionally, bit strings are useful for interpretting a collection of bits
 * as either a signed or an unsigned number. Since JavaScript has no concept of
 * an unsigned number, it can be difficult to interpret results. This class
 * takes care of translating the bits in the string into either a positive or
 * a potentially negative JavaScript `number` automatically, subject, of course,
 * to the aforementioned limitations of `number`.
