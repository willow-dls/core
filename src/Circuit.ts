   * > - Similarly, circuits go into a stable state before processing input signals from

   * > These limitations are due to the event-driven architecture of the engine, which this

   *
   * @param inputs A keyed object of input values or an array of input values. For end users, the
   * keyed object will provide the most intuitive interface; the array syntax exists to support
   * CircuitVerse {@link SubCircuit}s, which don't have labeled inputs, but rather take their inputs
   * by index. See the documentation for {@link CircuitRunType} and {@link CircuitRunResult} for
   * more information on this parameter.
   * @param haltCond A callback function which is executed each clock cycle and accepts a boolean
   * representing whether the clock is currently high or low, the clock cycle number, and the current
   * state of the circuits outputs. This function returns a boolean value indicating whether or not
   * the simulation should be halted: a value of `true` indicates that the simulation should be
   * halted, and a value of `false` indicates that it should continue on to the next clock cycle.
   * @param clockFrequency An optional number which specifies the clock "frequency". The simulation
   * speed is not changed (the simulation always executes as fast as possible), but if this parameter
   * is provided, the simulator will emit a warning if a circuit takes longer than this amount of
   * time to propagate its value. If you see this warning, the output values of the circuit probably
   * cannot be trusted because of the limitations stated above.
